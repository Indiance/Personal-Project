# AndroidHeartRateApp
Heart Rate App for my personal project. This app uses the ANT+ Android SDK that can be found at https://www.thisisant.com/ under the developer section. This app can be customizd to find other scans but as of now I shall be using only the heart rate monitors. 

My personal project is to learn Java, Android Studio and the ANT+ software to create an app that can detect Arrhythmia from the R-R intervals that the heart rate monitor gives. This will be instrumental in detecting Tachycardia and Bradycardia before it worsens.
