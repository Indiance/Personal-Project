# AndroidHeartRateApp
Heart Rate App for my personal project. This app uses the ANT+ Android SDK that can be found at https://www.thisisant.com/ under the developer section. This app can be customizd to find other scans but as of now I shall be using only the heart rate monitors. 

My personal project is to learn Java, Android Studio and the ANT+ software to create an app that can detect Arrhythmia from the R-R intervals that the heart rate monitor gives. This will be instrumental in detecting Arrhythmia before hand.

This was, is and will be a prototype for a long time and cannot be downloaded from the google play store yet. 

Requirements:
From the ANT+ developer webste (this link https://www.thisisant.com/directory/) make sure that you have a monitor as well as a phone that supports ANT minimum but having ANT+ would be recommended

Procedure: Given in the application itself. This gives the SDNN values as of now. If your SDNN is less than 50, then there is a problem with your heart and you need to check it out immediately. If SDNN between 50-100, your heart is in compromised health, exercise and better care required. If SDNN above 100 your heart is very fit. (Note: Final SDNN value to be noted and observed post 1 minute or more).
